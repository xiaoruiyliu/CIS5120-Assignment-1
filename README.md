# CIS5120-Assignment-1

To run the code: The program should run out of the box (same as Activity 1).

Attributions: AI (Chat-GPT) was used to generate many new concepts, particularly:
- The formatting of multiple and nested column/containers.
- The dropdown/accordion functionality.
- The automated generation of the grid-table for the calendar and the overlaying on top of the grid.
- Related css style templates. 
- Additionally, some of these programs were reused since many functionalities were repeated over the mock-up (such as accordion buttons, input boxes, etc).
